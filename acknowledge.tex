%I am grateful to David Hogg for being a great advisor and teacher. 
%I thank him for his consistent support, 
%encouragement, patience, teachings, and all the valuable skills I learned from him.

%I came to NYU hoping to work on theoretical high energy physics.
%But with no prior experience in programming and data analysis, I ended up working on 
%computaional and observational cosmology. If it was not for David Hogg's consistent support, 
%encouragement, patience, and teachings, I would have not made it to 
%this point. I learned a lot of valuable lessons and skills from interacting with 
%my advisor.
%Throughout my PhD years, 

%I also have had the opportunity to immensly benefit from collaboration and 
%interaction with Ross Fadely (Insight), Andrew Hearin (Yale), ChangHoon Hahn (NYU), 
%Dan Foreman-Mackey (UW), Kilian Walsh (NYU), Paco Kitauro (IAC), Yu Feng (Berkeley), 
%Albert Chuang (Leibnitz), and Alex Malz (NYU).

%I would have not been able to made any progress if it was not for the 

%I would like to acknowledge the fantastic computational support that I received at NYU. 
%I am grateful to Shenglong Wang (the administrator of NYU HPC) and Mulin Ding (the administrator 
%of CCPP computational facilities) for their persistent support and 
%phenomenal work ethics. 

%I would also like to thank David Hogg, Dan Foreman-Mackey, 
%Dustin Lang, Jeremy Tinker, and Gustavo Yepes for their computational support. 

%I truely enjoyed the lively and intellectually stimulating atmosphere at CCPP.
%I also want to thank all my great friends in graduate school who helped create a 
%supportive and fun environment for everyone.  

%I also thank my family who have always supported me throughout my entire life!
