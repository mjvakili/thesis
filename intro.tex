We are entering a new era of cosmology. Thanks to the ongoing and 
the upcoming galaxy surveys, we are going to be able to measure cosmological 
parameters within a few percent level precision. This ambitious goal 
can only be achieved if we keep the uncertainties arising from 
astrophysical and observation systematics below the statistical errors.

%Furthermore, there is a wealth of information in small scale galaxy clustering. 
%We can place unprecedented constraints on the cosmological parameters and the growth of structure. 
Furthermore, rigorous probe of the clustering of galaxies on small scales 
can shed light on how galaxies form and how they trace the underlying dark matter density field.
Characterization of the galaxy clustering signal on small scales requires assuming a halo model. 
Combining multiple probes such as galaxy-galaxy auto correlation function and galaxy-matter cross 
correlation has been shown to provide a powerful cosmological probe after marginalizing out 
the galaxy-halo connection.

With the spectroscopic surveys such as eBOSS \citep{eboss}, DESI, and Euclid \citep{euclid}, 
we are going to precisely constrain the expansion history of the universe as well as the growth of structure. 
With these constraints, we will be able to distinguish different physical scenarios that explain the accelerating expansion of the universe. 
A crucial component of BAO and RSD analyses is estimation of the uncertainties of the statistical summaries of 
the data obtained from galaxy surveys. One of the most promising frameworks for estimating the uncertainties in form of covariance matrices is production 
of a large number of accurate simulations of our observations. 

Furthermore, we live in the era of systematic dominated measurements. 
Therefore it is important to make use of statistical techniques that mitigate 
biases arising from these systematic errors. It is important to design end-to-end simulations of the survey.

Gravitational lensing of luminous sources (\eg\ galaxies) can measure 
the state of the inhomogeneous matter density and the time-dependence of dark energy. 
\citep{}. Cosmic shear studies are hurdled by a number of statistical uncertainties (\eg\ unknown distribution 
of galaxy intrinsic morphologies) and systematics. The long list of systematic error budget 
of cosmic shear studies can in general fall into the following categories: uncertain distance 
(photometric redshift) information, and imperfect knowledge of intrinsic alignments of galaxies and non-linear matter 
power spectrum models, and image systematics. 

Tomographic reconstruction of the distribution of dark matter with imaging surveys requires 
accurate distance information which is encoded in the redshifts of galaxies. 
The redshift estimated from the imaging surveys is usually uncertain as it is measured with coarse 
spectra in the form of a few magnitude numbers based on broadband photometry. These redshifts are called 
photometric redshifts and their accuracy depends on the number of broadband filters and the overlapping spectroscopic 
sample of galaxies \citep{bonnett2016,choi2016,boris2016,hildebrandt2017}. %FIXME BORIS AND HOGG?

Intrinsic alignment of galaxies (IAs) also contaminate the cosmic shear signal. These IAs, if not accounted for, 
can significantly bias the cosmological parameter inference \citep{codis2015,joachimi2015, kirk2015,krause_ia}. 
Cosmological interpretation of the cosmic shear signal requires an accurate knowledge of the nonlinear 
matter power spectrum \citep{semboloni2013, eifler2015, schaye2015, joudaki2016, kitching2016, mead2016}. The role of 
Modeling the Baryonic feedback and the accuracy of the emulators for nonlinear matter clustering remains an active area of research. 

Perhaps the most widely and extensively studied sources of systematics in weak lensing are the image systematics which make 
the process of inferring the cosmic shear from noisy images of galaxies is far from trivial. The light profile of 
galaxies is distorted with the atmosphere and telescope optics. The amount of distortion is captured in a kernel called 
the Point Spread Function (PSF). The size and anisotropy of the background galaxies used in weak lensing studies is 
smaller than those of the PSF, making the cosmic shear signal dominated by the PSF which is empirically estimated at the positions of stars and 
then interpolated to the positions of galaxies.  

Furthermore, additional systematics arise from unrealistic models of galaxy light profile \citep{voight2010,im3shape,kac2014}, 
detector effects \citep{arun2016,jaya2016,plazas2016}, and bias of the point estimates of shear due to nonlinear dependence of galaxy ellipticities 
on the pixel data in the presence of noise \citep{melchoir,great3,conti2017}, incorrect model of the PSF or inaccurate PSF interpolation 
\citep{rowe2010,kuijken2015,great3,des}.

These systematics lead to shear calibration biases in the form of additive and multiplicative 
shear biases. For instance, an incorrect size or ellipticity in the PSF model could introduce 
an additional term to the estimated the cosmic shear which has the same order of magnitude as 
the cosmological signal.

The shear biases are either calibrated with realistic image simulations \citep{im3shape,jee2016,conti2017} or through cross correlation of 
the cosmic shear signal with other cosmic probes that do not suffer from the same biases (\eg\ galaxy positions)
\citep{liu2016,schann,singh2017}. 

Simulation based techniques are limited due to difficulty in 
generation of realistic galaxy image simulations \citep{great3,lanus2017} and our limited ability to match the depth and detection limits of 
the imaging surveys \citep{hoekstra}. The limitation of cross-correlation technique is that it makes strong assumptions about the assigning a 
single bias parameter to a large population of galaxies under consideration. The shear biases have been shown to be scale-dependent \citep{des,jee2016} 
and depend on galaxy properties \citep{im3shape,conti2017}. 

Modern shear inference models that do not rely on delivering a point-estimate for the shear signal \citep{schneider,bernstein,huff,sheldon} 
provide promising venues for mitigation of biases but their accuracy is limited to the accuracy in the PSF model.
In chapters 1 and 5, we try to address two challenges in accurate PSF modeling that could lead to biases in cosmological weak lensing analysis. 

One of the steps of astronomical image processing that could lead to inaccurate model of the PSF is centroiding 
of stars. An erroneous method for determination of the centroid of stars could lead to both inaccurate estimation of the 
PSF at the positions of stars and inaccurate PSF interpolation \citep{anderson2000,lupton,anderson2003,desc}. Large astronomical surveys rely on approximate 
methods for centroiding the stars \citep{sextractor,sdss,des}. 

In chapter one we argue that in the presence of noise, there exist
a lower bound on the error arising from centroiding methods. We show that this theoretically set lower bound, also known as the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound \citep{lecam}, 
is \emph{almost} saturated by centroiding methods that rely on correlating the images of stars with the PSF or some approximation to the 
PSF. These centroiding methods are called matched-filter centroiding methods and in certain limits provide an approximation to the more accurate 
methods that rely on fitting a model to the stars. 

Additionally, weak lensing shear couples the short wavelength and long wavelength modes of the galaxy light profiles. 
Therefore estimation of the response of galaxy light profile to shear requires knowing the model of galaxy image 
with a resolution better than the PSF that the image of galaxy is convolved with. 

In most space telescope \citep{euclid,wfirst} the detectors are designed to be large in order to yield wider field of view. 
That is, the detectors sample the light profile of the PSF at a lower resolution. In such cases, a large fraction of the light of a given point source 
is captured by the pixel that contains the centroid of the point source. In other words, the PSF is \emph{undersampled}.

Most galaxies of interest for weak lensing studies with these space-based weak lensing experiments are unresolved. 
As a consequence, estimating the shear from unresolved galaxy images requires 
knowing the the galaxy light profile model and the PSF at higher resolutions than the native pixel size of the telescopes \citep{olic,ngole2}.

The filters in \hst\ \wfc\ IR channel have the most undersampled detectors among all \hst\ filters. 
As such, \hst \wfc\ IR channel could benefit a lot from an accurate model of its super resolution PSF. 
In this chapter 5, we present the first generative forward model of stellar sources as observed by the HST camera.
Unlike previous attempts at inferring the PSF model of \hst\ \wfc\, our model for is empirical in that it makes 
use of the observed data and it presents a proper treatment of modeling in the presence of damaged pixels, overlapping 
point sources, \etc\.  

Galaxy surveys will provide a valuable legacy dataset that can be used for detailed galaxy formation studies. 
These investigations will provide a window into how the visible structures in the observable universe 
trace the underlying invisible dark matter density. Furthermore, more comprehensive knowledge of galaxy-dark matter connection 
can inform cosmological parameter inferences with galaxies.
